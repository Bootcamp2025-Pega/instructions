            <aside class = "notes">
            <ul>
              <li>
                Git flow is a branching model that helps developers keep track of features,
                releases, and hotfixes.
              </li>
              <li>
                The main branches are master and develop. Feature branches are created from develop
                and merged back into develop.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a release is ready, a release branch is created from develop. Once the release
                is ready, it is merged into master and develop.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hotfixes are created from master and merged back into master and develop.
              </li>
              <li>
                This model helps to keep the codebase clean and organized.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is important to follow the Git flow model to ensure that the codebase is stable
                and that changes are properly tracked and managed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Git flow is a widely used branching model and is recommended for most projects.
              </li>
              <li>Our project is smaller, so we will use simpler flow.</li>

              GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool that allows you to automate your workflow.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can create custom workflows that run on GitHub events like push, pull request, issue, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can use GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy your code.
            </li>
            <li>
              GitHub Actions is free for public repositories and offers free minutes for private repositories.
            </li>
            <li>
              GitHub Actions is easy to set up and use, and it integrates well with GitHub.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can use GitHub Actions to automate your CI/CD pipeline and save time and effort.
            </li>
              <li>
                Github actions are defined in .github/workflows directory.
              </li>
              <li>
              Workflow is defined in YAML format. It consists of jobs, steps, and actions.

                Static code analysis is a method of debugging by examining source code before a program is run.
              </li>
              <li>
                It's done by analyzing a set of code against a set (or multiple sets) of coding rules.
              </li>
              <li>
                Static code analysis can be done by tools like SonarQube, CodeClimate, or ESLint.
              </li>
              <li>
                Static code analysis can help identify potential security vulnerabilities, code smells, and bugs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Static code analysis can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Static code analysis can help improve code quality and reduce technical debt.

              <li>
                Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a type of security testing that is performed without executing the code.
              </li>
              <li>
                SAST tools analyze the source code or compiled code to identify security vulnerabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                SAST tools can help identify security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and buffer overflows, hardcoded secrets, insecure dependencies, unvalidated inputs.
              </li>
              <li>
                SAST tools can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the process.
              </li>
              <li>
                SAST tools can help improve the security of your code and reduce the risk of security breaches.
