# DevOps in Action: A Hands-On Guide to Building a Modern SDLC

Welcome to the DevOps Bootcamp! This bootcamp is designed to give you hands-on experience with setting up a standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for a simple application, using GitHub, GitHub Actions, and other free-tier DevOps tools. Over the course of this 3-hour interactive session, you’ll learn how to:

* Create and manage a GitHub repository.
* Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
* Deploy applications to free-tier service.

# 1. Requirements

## 1.1. Prerequisites

* Basic command-line skills: Comfort with navigating directories and running simple commands in a terminal.
* Git & GitHub basics: Understanding of how to clone a repository, commit changes, and push to a remote branch.

## 1.2. Materials

* A laptop.
* A GitHub account (free).
  
  During the workshop we will work on GitHub Codespaces. This ensures everyone has a uniform environment, reducing setup issues.
