# DevOps in Action: A Hands-On Guide to Building a Modern SDLC

Welcome to the DevOps Bootcamp! This bootcamp is designed to give you hands-on experience with setting up a standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for a simple application, using GitHub, GitHub Actions, and other free-tier DevOps tools. Over the course of this 3-hour interactive session, you’ll learn how to:

* Create and manage a GitHub repository.
* Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
* Deploy applications to free-tier service.

# Requirements

## Prerequisites

* Basic command-line skills: Comfort with navigating directories and running simple commands in a terminal.
* Git & GitHub basics: Understanding of how to clone a repository, commit changes, and push to a remote branch.

## Materials

* A laptop.
* A GitHub account (free).
* Pre-Configured VirtualBox Image (Recommended):
  
  We will provide a downloadable VirtualBox image that includes all necessary software (Git, Node.js, text editor, Docker, etc.).
  
  This ensures everyone has a uniform environment, reducing setup issues.

## Technical Setup

Before the bootcamp starts, please ensure the following:

* GitHub Account
  
  Create a free GitHub account if you don’t already have one.

* Install VirtualBox
  
  Download and install VirtualBox for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
  
  Ensure you have sufficient disk space (at least 10–15 GB) to import the virtual machine.

* Import the Pre-Configured Virtual Machine

    Download the .vbox file provided by the bootcamp organizers
    [link](https://example.com/virtualbox-image)
    
    In VirtualBox, go to File > Import Appliance (or a similar option) and select the downloaded file.
    
    Follow the prompts to complete the import.
