# DevOps in Action: A Hands-On Guide to Building a Modern SDLC

Welcome to the DevOps Bootcamp! This bootcamp is designed to give you hands-on experience with setting up a standard Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for a simple application, using GitHub, GitHub Actions, and other free-tier DevOps tools. Over the course of this 3-hour interactive session, you’ll learn how to:

* Create and manage a GitHub repository.
* Implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
* Deploy applications to free-tier service.
